# A column is a file of tab-separated rows under bin_test/conformance. Nothing here compares them:
# `Table` does that, because a runner that decided what agreement meant would have to be built into
# every column, and then a column could disagree about the definition.
#
# **A case can abort rather than throw.** hxcpp's cppia has taken the process down more than once, so
# a run that stops early is resumed past whatever killed it and that case is recorded as `killed`,
# which is the most important reading about it rather than one to lose.
