/**
 * Every hxcpp-only test, in one program.
 *
 * These need what only hxcpp has: cppia needs `-D scriptable`, and the DCE probe is asking a question
 * about a static target's build. Running them beside the portable suite would mean the other eight
 * targets could not build it at all.
 *
 * The manual tools are deliberately not here: the timings live in `test/bench/cpp` and `SwitchProbe`
 * is one too, `CppiaDump` and `CppiaOne` print bytecode for a human to read, and
 * `FieldFormProbe` walks a directory named on the command line. None of them asserts anything a
 * runner could check, and folding a 200,000-iteration timing into the suite would make it slow for
 * no signal.
